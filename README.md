# Bioinspired UAV with Integrated Solar Cells — CAD Prototype

This repository contains the CAD models, assembly files, and supporting documentation
for a bioinspired flapping-wing UAV prototype equipped with flexible solar cells.

The prototype was developed to support experimental investigations on solar energy
harvesting in bioinspired aerial vehicles under oscillatory wing motion.
